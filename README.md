# Caesar Cipher : Encoder and Decoder

this project is just for study/practice "C" programming language. my cyber-security teacher (Rafael Sousa) gave it to me as an exercise

# what's Caesar Cipher?

In cryptography, Caesar's Cipher, also known as exchange cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar's exchange, is one of the simplest and most known cryptography techniques

The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the encrypted alphabet and the normal alphabet rotated right or left by a number of positions. For example, here is a Caesar's cipher using a left-hand rotation of three positions (the change parameter, three in this case, is used as key)

Normal:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Encoded: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC


# how to use (multiples shifts/keys) to encode and decode


if you uses windows : just install and run the executable file (caesar_cipher_custom.exe)

if you uses Linux or macOS, sorry you have to build (compile) the "caesar_cipher_custom.c" file

# how to use (locked in shift/key 3):

if you uses windows : just install and run the executable file (caesar_cYpher.exe)

if you uses Linux or macOS, sorry you have to build (compile) the "caesar_cYpher.c" file.
